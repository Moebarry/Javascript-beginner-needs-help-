I am currently doing the introduction to Javascript on codeacademy but i've kind of hit a wall. I get this error SyntaxError: Identifier 'newVariable' has already been declared everytime i try to reassign a variable. Here is the code- let newVariable = 'Playing around with typeof.'; console.log(typeof newVariable); let newVariable = 1    Now what i am basically trying to do is change the first variable to the number 1. I can do that by deleting the first variables value and just adding one but the codeacademy course requires me to have the previous variables value on the screen aswell as the now changed variable. How do i change said variable without deleting the first ones value?
